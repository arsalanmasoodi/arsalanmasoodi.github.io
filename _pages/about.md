## About me
I am a final-year undergraduate student in Electronics and Communication Engineering, with a strong interest in **neuromorphic hardware architectures** and **low-power VLSI design**. My academic focus lies at the intersection of **device-level understanding**, **RTL/system-level design**, and **open-source ASIC toolchains**.

I am particularly interested in how principles from neuroscience such as event-driven computation, sparse activity, and local learning—can be translated into efficient silicon implementations. My work combines hands-on circuit simulation, RTL development, and full ASIC flows, with the goal of building scalable and energy-efficient computing systems.
